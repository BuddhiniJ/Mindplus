  "Box breathing (4-4-4-4)":
    "Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat this slow rhythm a few times.",
  "Self-compassion check-in":

    "Step away for 5 minutes: stretch, drink water, or look out of a window. Let your body reset a little.",

    "Work for 25 minutes on a single task, then rest for 5. Repeat a few cycles and keep tasks small and specific.",
  "Two-minute small start":
    "Commit to only 2 minutes of a task. Often, starting is the hardest step and momentum will carry you afterwards.",
  "Mindful breathing":
    "Bring attention to your breath. Notice the air moving in and out, and gently return your focus when your mind wanders.",
